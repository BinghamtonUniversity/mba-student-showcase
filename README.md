mba-student-showcase
====================

An online showcase for resumes of current MBA students.

Structure of the site:

1. It would contain an introductory message or appeal. This could be optional first space and could be further expanded if a reader is interested. Otherwise a concise short heading with a few lines of text would be displayed.
2. A list of expertise list would be included for the user to choose from for viewing student profiles. This would be the primary search function. 
3. Optional:  search box could be provided to search inside resumes and come up with relevant results which could not be articulated in the standard expertise tags
4. A list of relevant students list would be displayed (with a small photo) and an expandable brief overview about themselves.
5. Optional: linked in profile link url could be provided to link to an external linked profile. Or this could be replaced by a link to PDF of the resume.

An admin panel would be provided to handle the following:

1. Addition/deletion/updating student profiles and their resumes
2. Addition/deletion/updating of student expertise tags
3. Student profiles would have matching expertise list.
4. Publish/un-publish a profile of student, thus giving room to have a draft.
5. Password protection for admin panel
6. Optional: ability to add new admins (as I guess there would be only one admin)
7. Optional: We can include an inbuilt doc/txt converter to PDF (using open-source platforms in php) that would help students submit resume in doc/txt too.
8. Optional: Submitting of a resume could be decentralized if there are many students. I.e a link could be sent to their email address asking them to upload their resume. This link could be an unique url (some combination of hashes?) with a password (password mentioned in the email).
9. MySQL database to be used.
